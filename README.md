# What is Gitness and where is Drone
Gitness is our new open source development platform packed with the power of code hosting and automated CI pipelines.

Gitness represents a massive investment in the next generation of Drone, with the goal to bring code management and pipelines closer together.\
The idea is for Gitness to eventually be at full parity with Drone in terms of pipeline capabilities, allowing users to seemlessly migrate from drone to gitness.
But, we expect this to take some time, which is why we took a snapshot of Drone as a feature branch [drone](https://github.com/harness/gitness/tree/drone) ([README](https://github.com/harness/gitness/blob/drone/.github/readme.md)) so it can continue development. As for Gitness, the development is taking place on the [main](https://github.com/harness/gitness/tree/main) branch.

## As a Drone customer, do I have to migrate to gitness?
No. You can continue to use Drone. Gitness is still in its early stages, but long term it will have all the Drone pipeline features. 

Gitness will also continue to integrate with GitHub, GitLab, Gitea etc. Nobody will be forced to use Gitness code hosting to use the Pipeline portion of the software.
